# Kino Koszyk

School project utilizing wordpress. We where tasked to make a demo for a webpage for photo/film studio Kino Koszyk, using their content to show our take on it. 

## About
We were put in to teams of four programmers and four designers to create a website together. During the project we got to familiarize ourselves with wordpress concepts such as creating our own theme, the templeta hierarchy, managing content in the wp interface and utilizing Advanced custom fields. We also set up our enviroments in Local. 

## Challenges
During the project we learned alot on the fly as it was our first project in WP. For various reasons some of us had to work from distance for parts of the project, it proved slightly more challenging working with WP than in previous projects, as we had to sync up the content weÂ´d added to wp and the specifics of AFC every once in a while.
